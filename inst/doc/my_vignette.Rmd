This package contains functions that carry out power operations, log transformations, and conversion between Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates.

Specific functions include:

  * `square` which squares a number or vector (i.e. raise to power of 2).

  * `cube` which cubes a number or vector (i.e. raise to power of 3).

  * `pow` which raises a number or vector to any power specified by the user.

  * `logarithm` log transforms a number or vector. The `base` of the log is specified by the user.

  * `polar_transform` converts two vectors in Cartesian coordinates into radius and angle, which specify the vectors' polar coordinates.
  

First let us load the package:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(powers)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Using `square()`, `cube()`, and `pow()` functions

We will start off with some easy functions to see how the power operations are run.

```{r}
square(1:10)
cube(1:10)
pow(1:10, a=10)
```

The `square` and `cube` operations can be used with `apply` functions. In other words, functions in the `powers` package can operate on each number or vector in a list, sequentially. 

```{r}
my_list <- list(1:10, 0.5, -0.7)

## Operate on this list using square, cube, and pow

lapply(my_list, square)
lapply(my_list, cube)
```

Let's try using `pow` and raise each element in the list to the power of `10`. 

```{r}
lapply(my_list, function(x){pow(x,a=10)})

```


## Using `logarithm()`

This function takes a log of a vector. The base of the logarithm is specified by the user.

```{r}
logarithm(1:10, base=2)
logarithm(5, base=exp(1))
```


## Using `polar_transform()`

This function transforms Cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates, as specified by `r` and `theta`. Output is a list.
  
  * `r` is the radius, given in the first element of the list output.
  * `theta` is the angle between the `(x, y)` and the x-axis, as provided in the second list of the output.

```{r}
polar_transform(1:10, 2:11)
polar_transform(5, 1)
```
